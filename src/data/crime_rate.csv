"1. A census metropolitan area (CMA) consists of one or more neighbouring municipalities situated around a major urban core. A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000 of which 50,000 or more live in the urban core. To be included in the CMA, other adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the central urban area, as measured by commuting flows derived from census data. A CMA typically comprises more than one police service."
"2. CMA populations have been adjusted to follow policing boundaries."
"3. The Oshawa CMA is excluded from this table because of the incongruity between the police service jurisdictional boundaries and the CMA boundaries."
"4. Gatineau refers to the Quebec part of the Ottawa–Gatineau CMA."
"5. Ottawa refers to the Ontario part of the Ottawa–Gatineau CMA."
"6. As of the 2016 Census, Belleville and Lethbridge became new CMAs."
"Note(s):"
"Police-reported statistics may be affected by differences in the way police services deal with offences. In some instances, police or municipalities might choose to deal with some offences using municipal by-laws or provincial provisions rather than Criminal Code provisions. The Crime Severity Index (CSI) is based on Criminal Code incidents, including traffic offences, as well as other federal statute violations. For the CSI, the base index was set at 100 for 2006 for Canada. The crime rate is based upon Criminal Code incidents, excluding traffic offences. Rates are calculated on the basis of 100,000 population. Percentage changes are based on unrounded rates. Populations are based on July 1 estimates from Statistics Canada."
